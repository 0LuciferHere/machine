# The non-reference docs have been moved!

The non-reference documentation for Docker Machine has been merged into
[the general documentation repo](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io).

The conceptual and guide docs for Docker Machine are now here:
https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/tree/master/machine

The reference docs remain in this repo, at:
https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/docs/reference

As always, the docs in the general repo remain open-source and we appreciate
your feedback and pull requests!
